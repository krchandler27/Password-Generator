# Password Generator

## Description
This web app is a password generator. Being led with a series of multiple prompts, the user gets to choose from password criteria including: the length of the password (between 8-128 characters), if the user would like to include uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, or special characters. The user's password is then generated based on their response to each question. Enjoy!
